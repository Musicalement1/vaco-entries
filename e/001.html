                  <p><strong>Notes:</strong> The Echorinths are fast and agressive, never try to start a fight with them on purpose.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Echorinths are grotesque, otherworldly entities composed of shifting, amorphous flesh. They are distinguished by their unsettling appearance, particularly the presence of three large, glowing eyes arranged in what seems to be a line on their otherwise featureless forms. Their bodies are constantly shifting and pulsating, with patches of their flesh appearing translucent or translucent, revealing glimpses of what could be unnerving internal structures or energy currents flowing through their bodies. Their form defies conventional understanding of biology and anatomy, suggesting that they are not bound by the same physical laws as creatures from our dimension.

The most disconcerting feature of the Echorinths, however, is their unsettling behavior and inexplicable presence in the Shattered Beyond. These creatures appear to be able to manipulate and distort their environment, creating fleeting distortions in space and time around them. They move with an eerie, fluid grace, though their motives remain unclear.</p>
              <br>
          <p>
            Victims who have survived encounters with the Echorinths often speak of hearing distorted echoes or whispers in their minds, but none of these accounts seem to align perfectly. Some claim the creatures left behind strange marks on their bodies or in their surroundings—traces of a bizarre, incomprehensible script, or strange, alien patterns that resist interpretation.
          </p>
          <br>
        <p>
          The Echorinths are highly dangerous and their presence in our dimension should be reported to local authorities immediately since they are able to cross GateOpener. Attempts to interact with them are prohibited due to the unpredictable and potentially fatal consequences, for tanks, and beyond.
