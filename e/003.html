Nyxaloths are neither fully solid nor liquid, constantly shifting between forms, their bodies covered in an iridescent, sticky mucus that leaves behind a trail of thick slime wherever they go. The slime they secrete is not just a physical substance but a key feature: it contains Xenonite, a rare and volatile element. Xenonite reacts with the air, emitting a pungent, toxic gas that makes the air thick and suffocating, creating a near-impossible environment for creatures to breathe or thrive. The gas serves as both a defense mechanism and a means of incapacitating prey.

Nyxaloths have three long, sinuous tentacles that extend from their central mass, each equipped with razor-sharp tips that can ensnare and subdue any unfortunate being caught within reach. These tentacles can stretch to great lengths, allowing the Nyxaloths to ambush prey from a distance.
