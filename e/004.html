                    The Corrupted Souls are the remnants of a long-lost civilization that once passed through The Shattered Beyond. Twisted and broken by the catastrophic forces that shattered this realm, these entities are what remains of sentient beings who, over time, were consumed by despair and corruption. They wander the dimension as distorted echoes of their former selves, feeding on the suffering of others while perpetuating their cycle of decay. Now, these spectral entities are the last trace of a civilization lost to the chaos, their existence a haunting reminder of the destruction that tore apart not only their world but also their very souls.
